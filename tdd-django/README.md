## Learning Notes

### TDD
* TDD does not come naturally, it is more like a discipline.
* Do nothing until you have a test! "Test first, test first!".
* Take one step at the time.
* TDD steps:
    1. Write a test, run it and check that it fails as expected.

#### Functional tests = Acceptance tests = End-to-end tests
* How the application functions from the user's point of view.
* A sort of specification of the application.
* Tracks a *User Story*
* A human readable story that can be followed.

#### Unit Tests

In Python:
* Module `unittest`, needs to be imported as `import unittest`
* Tests are organised into classes, which inherit from `unittest.TestCase`.
* Any method whose name starts with test is a test method, and will be run by the test runner.
* setUp and tearDown are special methods which get run before and after each test (even if unsuccessful).
* `self.fail` fails no matter what with the given error message.
* Some additional `unittest` helper functions for test assertions: `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`.
* If called from command line, the `unittest` test runner can be launched by calling `unittest.main()` within `if __name__ == '__main__'`.

### Django
Creating a new project:
```
$ django-admin.py startproject <emph>projectName</emph> .
```
*manage.py* is Djangoâ€™s Swiss Army knife. 

Running a development server:
```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
