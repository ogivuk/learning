# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning

There is no well accepted definition of what is and what is not machine learning. Here are some examples of the ways that people have tried to define it:

* Arthur Samuel (1959), Machine Learning: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
* Tom Mitchell (1998), Well-posed Learning Problem: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, there is a given data set with already known correct output for input values.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into regression and classification problems:

* Regression problem: predict continuous valued output.
* Classification problem: predict discrete valued output.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is used when there is a need to derive structure from data with little or no idea what the results should look like.

Examples of unsupervised learning:

* Clustering: cluster given data points into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables.
* Non-clustering (Cocktail Party Algorithm): find structure in a chaotic environment.
