# Classification

The classification problem is just like the regression problem,
except that the values we now want to predict take on only discrete values.

There are two types of classification problems:
* **Binary classification problem**
    * where y ∈ {0,1}. 
    * 0 is also known as negative class and 1 as positive class.
    * 0 and 1 are also sometimes denoted as - and +, respectivelly.
* **Multiclass Classification Problem**
    * where y ∈ {0,1,2,...}
